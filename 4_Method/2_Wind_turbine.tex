\section{Wind turbine models}
The two-bladed rotating \gls{WGTM}s are made at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:rwtm}. They have a diameter of 45 \si{\mm}, and a hub height of approximately 65 \si{\mm}. Magnets are incorporated into the bottom of the models in order to mount them to a magnetic plate.
