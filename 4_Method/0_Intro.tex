In the following, the experimental setup will be explained. A short description of the \gls{RWTM}s that were used will be given, followed by an explanation of the process of designing and creating the \gls{AD}s. How the drag measurements in the wind tunnel were conducted and possible sources of uncertainty that occurred during the testing will also be highlighted. Finally, a summary of how the data was processed and how the calculations were conducted to find $C_d$ will be given.
