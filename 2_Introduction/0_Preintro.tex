In a world with a growing population, growing standards of living, and with it, a growing need for energy, simultaneous with an increasing focus on sustainability and environmentally friendly solutions, renewable energy has never been more relevant. The amount of onshore and offshore wind power is increasing, and numerous companies are working to find their role in the new market. Optimizing wind turbines and wind farms is an important aim, and researchers are using both simulations and experimental methods in order to explore different potentially efficient solutions. 

However, within both methods, modeling a wind farm with moving blades is often extremely complicated. Thus, simplifications, such as the actuator disk, are commonly adopted. The idea of the actuator disk is that it produces the same drag as the wind turbine, resulting in similar bulk characteristics in the wake. The physical wind tunnel analogue to an actuator disk is a static, porous disk. However, at this point in time, there are no clear directions and no scientific consensus on how to design and make these porous disks in order to mimic rotating turbines when conducting experiments.
