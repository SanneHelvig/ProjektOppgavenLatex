\section{Problem formulation}
The objective of the project described in this thesis is to develop a static, porous disk that has approximately matched characteristics to a small rotating wind turbine model provided by KTH, by matching the produced drag. In order to achieve this, the drag of the spinning wind turbine models are measured, and a variety of small-scale actuator disks are designed and 3D printed before drag measurements of the disks are conducted. Based on the results, the design will be honed in order to match the drag as closely as possible.
