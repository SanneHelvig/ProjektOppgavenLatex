In this thesis, the drag of a small-scale rotating wind turbine model is measured in a wind tunnel. Actuator disks, with three different solidities and two different layouts, were designed and 3D printed. Then, the drag on the ADs was measured, and the results compared to the rotating wind turbine models in order to find the best match. The disk with a non-uniform design and a solidity of 35\% turned out to be the closest match. 

%should be in norwegian too 
%difference between abstract and conclusion... 

%less than 200-300 words, shorter than conclusion , con should cover every important finding 
%add acknowledgement
%can have citations in conclusion but not abstract %avoid acronyms in both 

%transducer and human error 
%reviewpapers!! %antonia pp compare, see dynamic differences 
%disks are based on this... 

%picture of PIV setup 
%in conclu, some problems, I learned did, created these curves, and these are the closest ones to go fort with
