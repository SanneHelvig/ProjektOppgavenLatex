I would first and foremost like to thank my supervisor Jason Hearst, for always helping me out and supporting me, and for arousing my interest in aerodynamics in the first place. Through weekly meetings he has continued to push me and give me helpful input every step of the way, and he was always available when I needed som additional guidance.  

I would also like to thank Magnus Kyrkjebø Vinnes, for helping me out whenever I got stuck and for his patience and positivity whenever we were troubleshooting. My thesis would not be what it is without your guidance. 

I want to thank Lars Morten Bardal, for teaching me how to do calibrations, how to use the wind tunnel and for making the LabView program that he so kindly let me use.  

I also want to give my thanks to Olav Rømcke, for teaching me how to use power tools, and the rest of Jason's Ph.D. students for all their helpful input at out weekly meetings.  

Finally, I want to thank Adrian Bogen Skibelid, for proof reading, for all our sessions of throwing ideas back and forth, and for your continuous support.
